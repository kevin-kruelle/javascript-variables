# JavaScript Variables

## Activity 1

Each of the following steps should be completed by a new group member, unless otherwise stated

### Step 1

1. Choose a group member to Fork this repository, and clone to the folder where they keep their projects.
2. They should then add other group members as collaborators in GitHub.
3. All members should clone the forked repository into their projects folder
4. Use `touch` Inside the repository, create a new file called "activity-1.html". 
5. Within the repository, using terminal, create a new folder named 'js'. This will hold all external javascript files
6. Use `touch` to create a JavaScript file name 'basics-variables-1.js' inside the 'js' folder
7. Use git to add/commit/push the changes
8. All members use `git pull` to pull down the changes from the remote repository

### Step 2

1. The next group member should open the cloned repository in their code editor
2. Open the 'activity-1.html' file and insert the global structure
3. Link your HTML file with the JavaScreipt file. 
4. Use console to verify you are connected
5. Use git to add/commit/push the changes
8. All members use `git pull` to pull down the changes from the remote repository


### Step 3

3. Open `basics-variables-1.js` in your code editor
4. Create a constant variable with the name 'daysPerYear'. 
5. Give it the value `365`
6. Add `console.log(daysPerYear)`.
7. Save and Check in browser
6. Create another constant vairable with the name `hoursPerDay`
7. Give it the value of `24`
8. Add `console.log(daysPerYear)`
8. Refresh page in browser
7. Use git to add/commit/push the changes
8. All members use `git pull` to pull down the changes from the remote repository

### Step 4

3. Open `basics-variables-1.js` in your code editor
4. Using the previously created constant variables, calculate the hours in a year. Log the value out to the console
6. Refresh your page and view the console
4. Create a new constant variable for minutes per hour.
5. Calculate the amount of minutes per day and log this out to the console
7. Use git to add/commit/push the changes
8. All members use `git pull` to pull down the changes from the remote repository

### Step 5

3. Open `basics-variables-1.js` in your code editor
4. Calculate seconds per week and log to console
5. Calculate seconds per year and log to console

## Activity 2

In this activity you will use `prompt()` to capture user input and `alert()` to display messages back to the user.

### Step 3

3. Open `basics-variables-1.js` in your code editor
4. `prompt()` the user for a number value
5. Calculate and display to the user the area of a square from the user provided value
6. Calculate the area of a circle and display the reult to the user
5. Use git to add/commit/push the changes
8. All members use `git pull` to pull down the changes from the remote repository

### Step 4

3. Open `basics-variables-1.js` in your code editor
4. `prompt()` the user for a number value and save to a variable name 'width'
5. `prompt()` the user for a number value and save to a variable name 'height'
5. Calculate the area of a rectangle, display to the user
5. Use git to add/commit/push the changes
8. All members use `git pull` to pull down the changes from the remote repository


### Step 5

3. Open `basics-variables-1.js` in your code editor
4. Generate a random number and store the value in a variable
5. Prompt the user to guess a number
6. Alert to the user if they guessed right
5. Use git to add/commit/push the changes
8. All members use `git pull` to pull down the changes from the remote repository
